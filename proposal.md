# Community Software Analysis Proposal

## Software: *Firedrake*

Via use of the finite element method (FEM), Firedrake automates the solution of partial differential equations, enabling high performance and sophisticated simulations for many scientists and engineers. By leveraging the FEniCSx Project's Uniform Form Lnaguage, the Firedrake software package allows for the expressive specification of any PDE. It also incorporates PETSc for calling on programmable solvers. The package also works with a variety of meshes, including triangular, quadrilateral, and tetrahedral unstructured meshes, as well as layered meshes with triangular wedges and hexahedra. There are many finite element spaces that can be used to carry out computations with significant automatic optimizations. The software includes plenty of documentation and an active development cycle with many contributors affiliated with various different institutions including Imperial College London, University of Oxford, Baylor University, and University of Washington for the primary team.

### Notes/concerns/risks

There do not seem to be any significant potential risks with this project. It is extremely well organized and has an active mode of discussion with plenty of people currently contributing. If anything, my one concern would potentially be that it's too active, and that if poorly coordinated, something someone else is working on could break something I'm working on. This seems very unlikely given how good the channel of communication seems to be though, so it should be an interesting experience!
